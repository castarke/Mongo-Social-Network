## Description:
  In this project, we used Mongo and Mongoose to create a social network where you can create thoughts, users, reactions to thoughts, add friends, and remove friends. This project helped teach how to work with a NoSQL Database.
## Installation
  You will need to install Mongodb, mongoose,and express. It would be helpfull to install nodemon to help from having to restart the server after changes were made.
